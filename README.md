# AngularRegistration

## Project Overview
* Angular Registration app built following a Lynda.com course
    * [AngularJS: Adding Registration to Your Application](https://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/AngularJS-Adding-Registration-Your-Application/438887-2.html)
* After completing the course, I refactored the code to use Bootstrap
    * Initially, the course *did not* use Bootstrap, instead used a single stylesheet
    * Stylesheet file had 634 lines initially. 64 lines afterwards.

## Course Overview
* Description:
    <blockquote>
      Authentication is a fundamental part of any web application, but it can be notoriously difficult to implement. In this short course, you'll create a simple registration system that allows users to log in and out of your applications. By taking advantage of Google's Firebase authentication service, you can manage registrations easily and securely. In the process, you'll explore working with the AngularJS application structure (including routes and controllers), storing user information into the Firebase NoSQL database, and creating services to manage registration information throughout different controllers. This will help you create a great registration template that you can use as a starting point in a variety of web applications.
